#### As Professors, you are given access and editing abilities for course start and end dates.
##### To do this, go into the course and click on the gear in the top right corner.
##### From the drop down menu, click "Edit Settings."

##### Then, there is a section for Course Start Date and Course End Date.

##### Our suggestion is that you set the date one week prior to the actual start date.
##### The course should be set to end within a month of the end of the actual class.
##### This affects which courses are in the "Future", "Past", and "In Process" tabs on Moodle.

##### Click Save and Display after you have set the dates.
