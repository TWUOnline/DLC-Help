### Scheduled Support for Faculty

!!!! Thank you to all those who participated in our on-campus and Zoom sessions covering Online Learning Foundations and Assessment Strategies. We estimate that we helped ~225 people in one way or another on Monday and Tuesday!

After Friday, March 20, support for the Great TWU #OnlinePivot will be entirely online. Please see the table below for the hours that Academic Technology Ambassadors (student workers) will be available for drop-in consultations.

If there are gaps in the hours below, you should create a ticket by emailing [elearning@twu.ca](mailto:elearning@twu.ca). Colin and Scott will be available throughout the day as needed.

Please also check our [Community Support Hub](https://oet.sandcats.io/shared/rEfGT5cEIo2lMbZmYqUDDKYdHHgUKvW8SZre36e-e9F) for contact info of people willing to help. If you are willing to add your name to the list, please do!
