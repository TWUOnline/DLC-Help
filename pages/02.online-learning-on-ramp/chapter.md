Resources for preparing your course for disruptions to campus access.

> These resources DO NOT constitute TWU's official response to COVID-19. See [TWU.ca](https://www.twu.ca) for the latest official information.

Remember that you can always practice good hygiene etiquette by:
- Washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds
- Using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer (if soap and water are not available)
- Not sharing food or utensils with others
- Using proper coughing or sneezing etiquette (cough/sneeze into elbow or tissue, not hand)
- Staying home when sick

! This is an evolving set of resources...please check back often.
