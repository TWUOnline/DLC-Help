If you plan to teach over Zoom (not pre-recorded and uploaded), you should have a high speed internet connection with at least a **download/upload speed of 20Mbps.** Although you could get by with lower speeds, we want to offer students the highest quality stream possible. You can check your connection speed at [speedtest.net](https://www.speedtest.net). Keep in mind that other people or devices on your network will can impact your speed test. If you do not have a high enough bandwidth, **you might want to ask members of your household not to stream or download during your recordings** as this could negatively impact the stability of your Zoom meeting.
