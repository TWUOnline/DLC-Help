#### Why isn't my course showing in Moodle?

There are several reasons why your course might not be showing in Moodle.

* Your instructor has hidden the course while they are updating it.
* You are on the waitlist or pre-registered for the course.
  * Please contact the office of the Registrar.
* You are not up-to-date on your tuition payments.
  * Please contact the office of the Registrar.
  * Once you are up-to-date, your status will be updated.
* You registered very recently and our system has not synchronized yet.
  * We synchronize Moodle with Jenzabar \(our database of registrations\) at 1:30 pm and 6:30 pm weekdays.
* Your dashboard is only showing some of your courses.
  1. Scroll to the bottom of courses listed, scroll through other pages
  2. Have a look through your 'Past', 'Future' 'In Process' tabs.

     **NOTE: There has been some changes with this one, as your new Dashboard is divided into a number of tabs such 'Timeline', 'Courses', 'Future', 'In Progress' and 'Past'. Your new Dashboard should resemble the picture below.**

You may also have multiple pages, be sure to look for additional pages on your 'Courses' tab.
