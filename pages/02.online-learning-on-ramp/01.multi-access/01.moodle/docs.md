!! [Please check the announcement on the TWU website](https://www.twu.ca) for the latest updates regarding TWU's response to COVID-19.

In the event that access to TWU campuses is completely disrupted, there are several strategies that you may employ as faculty or staff to mitigate the impact on learners in your courses. However, before considering technological 'solutions' to the problem of limited or no access to campus, it is critical to recognize that if we find ourselves in that situation, there are a host of very human and messy pressures on learners in your classes, faculty and staff in your department, and administrators at all levels. These pressures and the associated stresses in all of our lives will never be resolved by 'going online'. Ever.

Above all else, remember to be human. Your courses are already disrupted and you will not be able to maintain the *status quo*. Your learners will not be able to maintain the *status quo*. Deans, AVPs, VPs, EDs and everyone who supports the work of learning at TWU will not be able to maintain the *status quo*. And that is ok.

It is important to note that all members of the TWU community will be under higher than normal levels of stress, and we know that high levels of stress lead directly to lowered ability of people to handle cognitive load. In short, stress makes it difficult to think and process information. This has significant impact on learners ability to engage at a level that might otherwise be expected.

### What can you do to get ready for possible disruption?

##### Learner Readiness

It is worth thinking about how prepared your learners are for moving online. We have created a brief 2-minute survey that we would be happy to share with you so that you can get some basic data on what to expect from your students. If you would like to deploy this survey with your students, please email [colin.madland@twu.ca](mailto:colin.madland@twu.ca).
