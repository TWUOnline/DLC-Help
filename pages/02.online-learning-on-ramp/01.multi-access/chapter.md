In planning for various scenarios pertaining to situations which prevent physical access to TWU campuses, the TWU GLOBAL Online team has adopted a Multi-Access Learning Framework (Irvine, 2009; Irvine, Code, & Richards, 2013) to support a virtual presence for teaching and learning.

This model is being suggested to assist TWU faculty as they attempt to balance between meeting the needs of on-campus learners with remote, isolated learners who are not able to access physical resources on one of our campuses. Remote or isolated learners and faculty may still access learning resources via Moodle – TWU’s Learning Management System (LMS) and with only a little preparation, teaching and learning activities can be shifted online and course access modes can be merged to enable learner choice and agency.

We have compiled a list of specific resources to assist faculty in setting up Moodle and other tech support to enable both learner and faculty access to teaching and learning resources in the case of campus closures. Click on the following topics of interest or see the left navigation menu for options:

1. **Use Moodle** to share course content, engage students in learning activities, communicate with students, and assess student learning.

2. **Use video conferencing** (asynchronous or synchrounous class sessions)

3. **Record audio or video** (e.g. of PowerPoint slides)

4. **Design for Online:** If you want to incorporate more online learning and teaching strategies, this section gives you an overview of key elements.
