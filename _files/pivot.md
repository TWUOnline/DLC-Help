## 

## **We care, and we’re dealing with our very human responses, as well.** 

### There’s a sense of **grief** about the sudden ending of regular campus/class interactions with and among students.

> **We feel deeply for students** and know that shifting to remote teaching isn’t easy for them. ![](/Users/colin.madland/Documents/GitHub/DLC-Help/_files/media/image4.png)
> 
> Amy McClure’s (sociology professor at Rollins College) illustrates her awareness of the difficulty facing many students via her Facebook post to the right. In another example, three science professors (Rollins College) woke up early on the suddenly-last-day-of-F2F-classes to hold an **impromptu graduation ceremony** for their seniors, complete with cap and gown, quickly drafted diplomas, and applause and tears. There are many, many more examples to share.
> 
> **Students and educators are feeling it** -- in their personal and academic lives.
> 
> “Communal crises, such as the unexpected death of a fellow student or teacher, the shock of 9/11, the devastation of Hurricanes Katrina and Sandy, the tragedy of the shootings at Virginia Tech, or the bombing of the Boston Marathon, can **affect everyone’s well-being—personal and academic**” (Chick, “[<span class="underline">Teaching in Times of Crisis</span>](https://cft.vanderbilt.edu/guides-sub-pages/crisis/)”).

### At the same time, we take our teaching and our students very seriously, so **we’re mobilizing in an initial phase of pedagogical triage**. 

> **This sudden move to remote teaching and learning contexts is *not “moving to online classes.”***

1.  > Teaching and learning experiences that happen in online or remote environments are (generally) carefully and purposefully designed well in advance of the term. **We simply don’t have the luxury of time right now.**

2.  > Rather, higher education is in a time of “pedagogical triage.” Most course instructors are tasked with quickly changing how and where they teach, which affects course content, assessment of learning, teacher/learner relationships, etc.

3.  > Even though many of us aren’t experts in online teaching, this is something different--and we’ve got this. The **majority of postsecondary institutions have mobilized units on campus to assist faculty with this unprecedented transition. Librarians** are negotiating with publishers to allow greater online access to materials**. Educational technology** units are working with companies to ensure stable access to tools. **Learning designers** are working around the clock creating materials and programming for faculty and students. **Faculty developers** are reaching out to faculty to help them through the transition and sharing available resources that foreground good teaching at a distance. **Student support services** are working around the clock to support students as many of them relocate and adjust to the new learning environments. We are all working together towards a common goal of helping each other and our students through this extraordinary situation.

4.  > Courses are shifting to distance learning in a variety of ways, **using different tools to support the range of activities that make up teaching and learning**, such as the following:
    
      - > Sharing content through their learning management systems/LMS (e.g., Blackboard, Canvas, D2L)
    
      - > Asynchronous interactions (class discussions, group work, interactive lectures) in their LMS
    
      - > Synchronous class sessions through web conferencing (e.g., Skype, Zoom, WebEx)
    
      - > Synchronous office hours through web conferencing and/or chat functions in their LMS
    
      - > Individual communication with and among students through email, phones, and the chat functions in their LMS or web conference system

> The global postsecondary community is also starting to share options for “[<span class="underline">low-bandwidth teaching</span>](https://www.iddblog.org/videoconferencing-alternatives-how-low-bandwidth-teaching-will-save-us-all/),” such as [<span class="underline">this guide</span>](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/brightspace/2020/03/17/low-bandwidth-teaching-tools-on-brightspace/) goes beyond any single platform, so we make responsive and smart decisions.

## **We’re ready for the challenge. As a community of professionals, we draw on a large body of research. Good teaching is good teaching.** 

### **We are guided by the research** on how students learn **and the resulting principles** **of good teaching**, and we can adapt them to different learning environments. We also draw from the research on how to do distance learning *well*.

<td><p><strong>Good teaching is based on what we know about how students learn.</strong> For example,</p>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p><em>Learning activities should be aligned with our goals for learning--and how we assess their learning (i.e., constructive alignment).</em></p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p><em>Students’ prior knowledge affects how well they learn, so we need to know (e.g., formative assessment, below).</em></p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p><em>Learning happens when students practice, make mistakes, interact with each other and us, so they need lots of practice of key concepts/skills (their practice, not ours), and low-stakes feedback on that practice.</em></p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p><em>There are evidence-based ways to motivate students.</em></p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p><em>There is excellent research on how to study effectively (e.g., retrieval practice).</em></p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p><em>And much more….</em></p>

<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Designing for learning (e.g., backward learning, guiding learning through engagement, and using media and technology tools)</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Teaching Humans (e.g., building community, giving feedback, and fostering student persistence and success)</p>

<tr class="even">
<td><p>Good teaching, while based on the research on how students learn, is also <strong>responsive to the specific students in class right now and in our specific contexts</strong>, not an abstracted or idealized “student.”</p>
<p>This means that, first, the <strong>instructor is present</strong> with the students in front of them.</p>
<p>Second, the i<strong>nstructor is aware of and responsive</strong> to these students’</p>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>prior knowledge (<a href="https://www.wiley.com/en-us/How+Learning+Works%3A+Seven+Research+Based+Principles+for+Smart+Teaching-p-9780470484104"><span class="underline">Ambrose et al, 2010</span></a>), and</p>

</blockquote></li>
</ul>
<p>And the instructor responds to the above by providing timely feedback throughout the learning process, not just in summative or graded work (<a href="http://www.columbia.edu/~mvp19/ETF/Feedback.pdf"><span class="underline">Hattie &amp; Timperley, 2007</span></a>; <a href="http://projects.ict.usc.edu/dlxxi/materials/Sept2009/Research%20Readings/Shute%202008%20Focus%20on%20formative%20feedback.pdf"><span class="underline">Shute, 2008</span></a>; <a href="https://www.wiley.com/en-us/How+Learning+Works%3A+Seven+Research+Based+Principles+for+Smart+Teaching-p-9780470484104"><span class="underline">Ambrose et al, 2010</span></a>).</p></td>
<td><p><strong>What does this principle of responsiveness look like in a virtual environment?</strong> This isn’t about posting lectures and going about our merry way.</p>
<p>Instructor <strong>presence</strong> in virtual learning environments is essential.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A <a href="https://journalhosting.ucalgary.ca/index.php/TLI/article/view/57407"><span class="underline">small study</span></a> of an instructor who had to move three of his geography courses into Skype/web conferencing for a week gives us a glimpse into what we may experience and some guidance on the importance of the professor’s “presence” for students. He aimed to “replicate the face-to-face experience as much as possible” to “stay true to the teaching values and objectives.” By looking at quiz and exam grades, he found that <strong>learning wasn’t affected</strong>, but his male students experienced the Skyped week more positively than his female students. He also found that <strong>students missed the student-professor interaction</strong> and the physical presence of the professor, which tended to “convey enthusiasm and explanations” in the regular F2F class. (They didn’t report missing each other because the students still met in the classroom, while the professor was ‘Skyped in.’) (Terence Day, “<a href="https://journalhosting.ucalgary.ca/index.php/TLI/article/view/57407"><span class="underline">Academic Continuity: Staying True to Teaching Values and Objectives in the Face of Course Interruptions</span></a>,” 2015)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This remote teaching or virtual learning will be <strong>interactive, focused on facilitating two-way communication</strong> between instructor and student.</p>
<p>Here are a few examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Asynchronous LMS quizzing tools and synchronous chat features lend themselves to formative assessments like minute papers, muddiest points, preconception checks</p>
</blockquote></li>

> A 2007 survey \[given to students about what happened in classes immediately after September 11\] by Therese A. Huston and Michelle DiPietro reveals “from the students’ perspective, **it is best to do something**. Students often complained when faculty did not mention the attacks at all, and they expressed gratitude when faculty acknowledged that something awful had occurred” (Huston & DiPietro, [<span class="underline">2007</span>](https://podnetwork.org/content/uploads/In_the_Eye.pdf), p. 219,). -- from Chick, “[<span class="underline">Teaching in Times of Crisis</span>](https://cft.vanderbilt.edu/guides-sub-pages/crisis/)”

> *“Higher Ed folks: Deep breath. It's okay: you don't have to have all the answers. You can be honest with students & tell them that you're just as sad/confused/upset as they are but--step by step--you will get through this together. They will always remember your honesty & humanity”. --* Tweet by *How Humans Learn* author [<span class="underline">Josh Eyler</span>](https://twitter.com/joshua_r_eyler)

> Parker Palmer stated in his foundational work *The Courage to Teach* (1998, p. 17): “...a good teacher must stand where personal and public meet, dealing with the thundering flow of traffic at an intersection where ‘weaving a web of connectedness’ feels more like crossing a freeway on foot. As we try to connect ourselves and our subjects with our students, we make ourselves, as well as our subjects, vulnerable to indifference, judgment, and ridicule.” ![](/Users/colin.madland/Documents/GitHub/DLC-Help/_files/media/image2.jpg)
> 
> The intersection we are standing in currently in higher education is one that requires an element of **faith in our abilities to reach our students in unfamiliar ways, connecting them to content, and caring for their needs -- all at the same time.** It is important that we talk about this with our students to mediate the change process we find ourselves in.

  - > **Teacher self-disclosure** has been shown to increase student engagement and interest in a course, promote a willingness to communicate outside of routine course settings, and (for the current times, perhaps the most important) build positive and responsive relationships between instructors and students ([<span class="underline">Cayanus, 2004</span>](https://nca.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/1740462032000142095?needAccess=true)). In online classes, research suggests that the positive impacts of teacher self-disclosure is stronger than in traditional course environments ([<span class="underline">Song, Kim, & Luo, 2016</span>](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563215300480)). **Sharing with students that things will be a little messy as the new normal emerges is not shameful. In fact, it just might be helpful.**

> There is a [<span class="underline">survey being circulated at Indiana U</span>](https://www.change.org/p/president-michael-a-mcrobbie-reimburse-iu-students-for-loss-of-in-person-instruction-and-use-of-campus?recruiter=906499572&recruited_by_id=4e2307e0-d316-11e8-bcb4-ff714def5ca9&utm_source=share_petition&utm_medium=copylink&utm_campaign=psf_combo_share_initial&utm_term=psf_combo_share_abi) by students asking for a tuition refund because online education is “substandard” to in-person. There may be room in this conversation to acknowledge that while imperfect, all teaching really is. And, while there's a learning curve in “remote teaching,” **course instructors are well-equipped as content experts and have access to plenty of research-supported resources to help make sure student learning is prioritized. This can and should be made clear to students.**

We should stay flexible, and focus on what’s important.

> Mind the cognitive load.
> 
> “Such events affect students’ cognitive load, as ‘working memory capacity is reduced immediately following an acutely stressful experience’ ([<span class="underline">Huston & DiPietro, 2007</span>](https://podnetwork.org/content/uploads/In_the_Eye.pdf), p. 218; [<span class="underline">Ambrose et al, 2010</span>](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/How+Learning+Works%3A+Seven+Research+Based+Principles+for+Smart+Teaching-p-9780470484104), p. 103+; [<span class="underline">Cavanaugh, 2016</span>](https://wvupressonline.com/node/642); [<span class="underline">Eyler, 2018, ch. 3</span>](https://wvupressonline.com/node/758)). This awareness may lead you to be **lenient with due dates** or adapt your syllabus for the week following the crisis to accommodate a **reduced workload**, both in terms of introducing new concepts and expecting students to exercise typical study habits. **Holding a review session** for material covered during the crisis may also be helpful.” (Chick, “[<span class="underline">Teaching in Times of Crisis</span>](https://cft.vanderbilt.edu/guides-sub-pages/crisis/)”)
> 
> “Covering content” is something talked about in higher education with regularity. Scholars have long been encouraging us to think not of “coverage” (cramming in as much content as possible) but instead of “uncoverage,” or **focusing on the essential questions and ways of thinking that we want to *endure*** (Wiggins & McTighe, [<span class="underline">1998</span>](https://www.worldcat.org/title/understanding-by-design/oclc/39539420), [<span class="underline">2005</span>](http://www.ascd.org/Publications/Books/Overview/Understanding-by-Design-Expanded-2nd-Edition.aspx); [<span class="underline">Calder, 2006</span>](http://www.indiana.edu/~tchsotl/part3/calder%20uncoverage_files/ContentServer_data/20248906.pdf)). Given the abrupt pivot many course instructors are making to their course delivery and design, it may be time to focus on “uncoverage”:

  - > **What do you want your students to remember about your course five years from now?** Look at your course calendar. Identify the MOST necessary skills/competencies your students need to know. Prioritize those. Consider the best ways to teach those skills/competencies well.

  - > **Change your syllabus in response to your reprioritization and explain WHY you’ve made changes to your students**. They will appreciate that type of transparency.

> Nicki Monahan illustrates this process in her blog post, “[<span class="underline">More Content Doesn’t Equal Learning</span>](https://www.facultyfocus.com/articles/effective-teaching-strategies/more-content-doesnt-equal-more-learning/).”
> 
> We should highlight what’s being done to help, and give students a way to help, a sense of agency.
> 
> *Teach hope. Mitigate any sense of helplessness.*
> 
> We know the importance--even in ‘normal’ times--of **teaching a sense of hope**. Two fantastic books are the following:![](/Users/colin.madland/Documents/GitHub/DLC-Help/_files/media/image3.png)

  - > Rebecca Solnit’s *Hope in the Dark: Untold Histories, Wild Possibilities* (2016)

  - > Kevin Gannon’s new book [*<span class="underline">Radical Hope: A Teaching Manifesto</span>*](https://wvupressonline.com/node/823) (2020) -- see image and quote to the right.

> We know, for instance, that many seniors are **worried that they won’t graduate**. We’re hearing from many, many colleges and universities that they’re committed to ensuring that the seniors who finish the semester *will graduate*.

  - > Mays Imad’s “[<span class="underline">Hope Matters</span>](https://www.insidehighered.com/advice/2020/03/17/10-strategies-support-students-and-help-them-learn-during-coronavirus-crisis?utm_source=Inside+Higher+Ed&utm_campaign=7cbfbb6184-DNU_2019_COPY_02&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_1fcbc04421-7cbfbb6184-198582105&mc_cid=7cbfbb6184&mc_eid=273b10a011)” article offers 10 specific strategies for giving students hope, including using language that’s optimistic and forward-looking, like “When you graduate…” or “when you come back this fall.”

> Hope comes also by **looking to the helpers**, by noticing the outpouring of community and good will and action.

  - > Fred Rogers famously talked about his mother’s advice during a tragedy to “[<span class="underline">Always look for the helpers.</span>](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LGHtc_D328)"

  - > Notice the **heightened humanity, kindness, community** (e.g., [<span class="underline">\#COVIDkindness</span>](https://twitter.com/hashtag/covidkindness?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Ehashtag) on Twitter).

> Hope also comes by empowering the students, helping them develop **a sense of agency**.

  - > Mitigate “learned helplessness,” potential sense of apathy resulting from being overwhelmed when learning (or hearing) about large-scale societal or environmental problems.
    
      - > We know from research on teaching about climate change ([<span class="underline">Salomon & Tannenbaum, 2017</span>](http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/83331/19/WRAP-climate-change-helplessness-individual-energy-behavior-Preston-2017.pdf)) and gender and racial inequality (Tatum, [<span class="underline">1992</span>](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/2fe7/9d71cf23f777978cfad561f3748ba5fff8c8.pdf), [<span class="underline">1994</span>](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1995-03559-001); [<span class="underline">Chick, Kernahan, & Karis, 2009</span>](https://digitalcommons.georgiasouthern.edu/ij-sotl/vol3/iss1/16/); [<span class="underline">Kernahan, 2019</span>](https://wvupressonline.com/node/802)) that **if we don’t include examples of how individuals can actually make a difference, student motivation and sense of efficacy--the sense that their “actions will have meaningful effects”--suffer.**

<!-- end list -->

  - > ... **identify or even facilitate a way to help those most affected by the crisis**, such as collecting money, donating goods, volunteering to help at the crisis site, or other ways of supporting rescue and relief efforts. Such “problem-focused coping” is among the most helpful responses identified by students and one explanation for the “lower levels of long-term stress” among people “indirectly affected” by 9/11 (Huston & DiPietro, 2007, p. 216-218).
    
      - > Opportunities for help right now will vary by community in terms of need and situation. Many communities will have restrictions on what individuals can do. **Look to local authorities for guidance on where help might be** (e.g., donations to school/campus/community food banks, purchasing gift cards online from shuttered local businesses).

### **We have support**--if not locally, then globally. 

> Many campuses have teaching and learning centers with faculty/educational/academic developers, instructional designers, educational technologists, and other colleagues who are a key part of the institutional support for teaching and student learning. These colleagues draw from the research and research-based principles to support teaching and learning in their institutions.
> 
> In reflecting on his own experience when he had to move his courses into Skype/web conferencing for a week, Terence Day concludes by emphasizing the **need for this institutional support**:
> 
> *Successful implementation of an academic continuity plan requires the encouragement of strong and collegial interpersonal relations. These relations fuel willingness to confront and overcome the challenges of working in a difficult environment. Nothing can happen without goodwill and commitment on the part of faculty, students, and the people around them.* (Terence Day, “[<span class="underline">Academic Continuity: Staying True to Teaching Values and Objectives in the Face of Course Interruptions</span>](https://journalhosting.ucalgary.ca/index.php/TLI/article/view/57407),” 2015)
> 
> Not all campuses have such institutional support. Fortunately, the global community of stakeholders in higher education has mobilized to provide mentorship, resources, and support to guide our efforts in teaching through this crisis. Many are contributing to these public and private platforms in support of peers and students so that course instructors can meet their immediate and future remote teaching needs.
