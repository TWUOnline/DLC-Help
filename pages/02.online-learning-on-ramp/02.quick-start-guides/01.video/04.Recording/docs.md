### Step 4: Recording A Class Session
Letâ€™s go through the software and systems you will using as you run your class.
#### Moodle
You should be aware that as of June 15, 2020, TWU has shifted away from MyCourses as our learning management system (LMS). Now we are using Moodle. There is great training available on Moodle which you can find as [a part of the Online Learning On-Ramp](https://create.twu.ca/help/online-learning-on-ramp/multi-access/moodle).
#### Zoom
For instructions on downloading, signing in and using Zoom, [click here.](https://create.twu.ca/help/online-learning-on-ramp/running-a-session/conferencing)
There are a few great video tutorials that should answer most of your questions.
#### Recording A Zoom Meeting
The following brief video explains the recording process, as well as where to find your files once your session is over.

**Ensure that you hit the record button** at the beginning of your teaching time (lower right hand corner of the Zoom user interface).

#### Uploading
Once your Zoom session is over, you will need to [upload your Zoom recordings to Microsoft Stream](https://create.twu.ca/help/online-learning-on-ramp/running-a-session/conferencing/managing-videos).

By now you should feel equipped with an understanding of the hardware, setup and systems required to run your classroom virtually. Should you need any assistance, please contact [elearning@twu.ca](mailto:elearning@twu.ca).
