As video conferencing, and online classes are becoming more the norm,  you might be considering how to improve your on-screen presence. If so, this guide is for you. For sorting through the techy side of things, as well as gear recommendations, please see [Sorting Through Your Techy Video Issues.](https://create.twu.ca/help/online-learning-on-ramp/quick-start-guides/video)

#### Looking Professional

Do you want to look professional on camera? Let’s start with the camera. Recording videos with a neutral camera position and good framing will feel most natural to anyone watching you on a screen. Start by positioning the camera at the same height as your eyes. Position yourself in the centre of the frame and leave a little space between the top of your head and the top of the frame. If you have lights, set them up ensuring that you have enough light directed at your face.
##### Avoid Poor framing

If you can, try and avoid poor framing. If your head is touching the top of the frame, it's too close!

##### Avoid Shadows

Whenever possible, do not use your  built-in microphone.

#### Participation

When participating in an online meeting or class, try and engage with the speaker. Remember that you aren’t watching a video, you are engaging with real people. Keep using listening cues, such as nodding, smiling or whatever body language you normally you would normally use in a face-to-face conversation. When you are not speaking, please mute your microphone. This will ensure you avoid sharing any potentially distracting environmental noises with other participants.
