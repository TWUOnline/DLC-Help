TWU has provided access to Microsoft Stream, which is like our very own YouTube, but accessible only to members of the TWU community.

When you record in Zoom, please record to your local computer, then upload to MS Stream.

### Accessing Stream

[Visit web.microsoftstream.com](https://web.microsoftstream.com) and sign in with your TWU Pass credentials, including your full TWU email address.

### Channel Details

- Give your channel a name that corresponds to the code for your course, e.g. BIOL 113 A.
- Enter a description (optional)
- Choose 'Companywide channel'
- upload a custom channel image (the only appropriate image for a channel is a cat, obvs.)

!! NOTE: For now, your videos will be visible *in MS Stream* to anyone who is logged into TWU's MS Stream account. They are **NOT** visible to anyone outside of the TWU organization. We intend to deploy more robust controls.
