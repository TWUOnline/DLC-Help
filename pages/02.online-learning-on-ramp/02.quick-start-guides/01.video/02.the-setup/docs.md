Great! Now that we have a working computer, camera and microphone, let’s talk about the ideal recording setup.

#### A Quiet Space
Hopefully you know a quiet space, free from distracting noises, pets or people. Keep this in mind when recording ([or presenting on live tv](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mh4f9AYRCZY)). Is there a door or window that could be closed? Is the dryer running in the next room? Is your phone on silent? Is There a fan blowing directly at your microphone? By limiting background noise you can greatly increase the quality of your recordings.

#### "What's That in the Background?"
So your room is quiet now. Great! But what does it look like? By keeping your recording background tidy, and free from visual clutter, you will help your students remain focused on what they are learning. They hopefully won’t be able to see your dog’s mournful, accusatory stare, just outside your office window.

#### Lighting
- Speaking of windows, when it comes to video quality, it’s important to remember not to record in the dark. If your recording space is too dark your students  will notice distracting image noise as your camera struggles to keep you visible.
- It’s also important to ensure that you have more light hitting your face than hitting the background behind you. Otherwise you risk being mistaken for a talking shadow. If a window does appear in your background, you might want to have the curtains pulled shut to ensure your background isn’t brighter than you (also your sad dog won’t be visible).
- To ensure your face is well lit, we recommend recording with a cheap ring light. The light should be directed towards you, at about the same distance as your camera.
- If you are feeling adventurous you could also [experiment with natural lighting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7Rf6u-XveM).

#### Camera Position
- Let’s make you look great! Ideally your camera should be positioned to line up with your eyes. This is the most natural, flattering angle (no-one wants a double chin).
- Unless teaching with whiteboard, or teaching aids, you should be in the centre of the frame with just a little bit of space between your head and the top of the frame.

There are a few options for positioning your camera to eye height:

- If you use a **laptop with built-in webcam** you can use a laptop riser in combination with an external keyboard and mouse. In addition to helping adjust the working height of your laptop, a laptop riser can help with cooling. Video conferencing (really anything video related) does put extra strain on your processor, so keeping the laptop elevated allows for better airflow from the vents, better cooling, less processor strain, and less risk of video stutter.
- If you use an **external webcam**, you could use a cheap tripod, extension arm, or if you have a height-adjustable external monitor, you could clip the webcam to the top.
