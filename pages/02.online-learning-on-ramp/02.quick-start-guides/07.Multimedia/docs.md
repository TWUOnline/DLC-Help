Covid-19 has certainly changed the way we see the world and what our educational experience looks like. Much of our class time is now online. But with these new restrictions comes a new opportunity for creativity. You may find that your instructors are asking you to submit your assignments in a digital fashion.  Our hope is to inspire you as you begin to plan your multimedia assignments. Below is a list of some of our favourite digital tools.

We have organized this list from easiest to techiest.   

#### Making Movies with PowerPoint

Did you know that PowerPoint can do more than make a slide show?  [This video tutorial](https://youtu.be/D8JV3w4TOVw)  shows you how you can transform your slides into a full video presentation.

#### Screen Recording

#####Screencast-o-matic
This next one is a freemium screen recorder.  What we mean by that is that the free version is basic and very functional, but to edit with this tool requires you to purchase a plan.  Why do we like it?  It’s pretty easy to use and it’s another option if you’re not a Powerpoint or Zoom fan.

Great news! If you've tried SOM and  you like it, you can request the full version through [TWIT](https://trinitywestern.teamdynamix.com/TDClient/1904/Portal/KB/ArticleDet?ID=16267).

#####Zoom - More Than Just a Meeting Space
Most people think that Zoom is only for meetings; however, it works well as a recording tool too with some handy features to boot.

####But I Don't Have a Camera!

You probably do have a camera. You probably use every day. Recording great quality video from a smartphone isn’t too difficult, but you may need to think re-think your setup.

####Planning Tips
![student making a plan in their notbook](planning.jpg)
1. Make a script, plan out what you want to say.
2. Practice before you hit the record button.
3. Organize and label your files before you begin to edit. This will save you a lot of time.
4. Use transitions, annotations and animations strategically.
5. If you add background music, ensure it doesn’t detract from your narration.
