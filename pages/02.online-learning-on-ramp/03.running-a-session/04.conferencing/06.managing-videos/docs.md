TWU has provided access to Microsoft Stream, which is like our very own YouTube, but accessible only to members of the TWU community.

When you record in Zoom, please record to your local computer, then upload to MS Stream.

### Accessing Stream

[Visit stream.microsoft.com](https://stream.microsoft.com) and sign in with your TWU Pass credentials, including your full TWU email address.

### We will update these instructions as we know more...thanks for your patience.
