### Step 1: The Hardware
Before we dive in, let’s take a moment and make sure you have all the tools you’ll need for the job. At minimum you will need a computer, a camera, and a microphone. There is more gear that might be relevant to you, but we’ll address that later.

#### The Computer
If you’ve had your computer for 5 years or less, it will most likely be able to handle most video conferencing software. Take a moment to consider the following system requirements for Zoom ([Mac](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gtd5k4lnWDM) or [Windows](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&q=find+windows+system+specs)):
- 2.5Ghz Dual Core Intel Core i5 (or higher) Processor
- 4GB Ram

#### The Camera
If your computer is a laptop with a built-in webcam, this will most likely be the simplest option for you. When it comes to cameras, bigger is not necessarily better, especially as technology continues to shrink down.

If you need to purchase a webcam, please consider something that would be capable of recording at HD resolution (1080p).

#### The Microphone
For your convenience you might be tempted to use your built-in microphone. Please don’t. Due to the proximity of the built-in mic to the noise transmitting parts of you computer (fans, hard drives, electric signals), the audio quality will suffer. For this reason we **STRONGLY** recommend using an external microphone. It will even make you look better (*user experience may vary*)! If you do not have something that will work yet, below are a couple of recommendations.

##### Wired Mic
If you don’t mind being tethered to your computer, and want something simple that will just work.

##### Wireless Mic
Enjoy unrestricted movement as you teach! But be mindful of potential connectivity issues depending on bluetooth strength or signal interference. Also remember to keep it charged before class.
