### What can you do to get ready for possible disruption?

##### Basic Moodle Preparation
There are also some things you can do ahead of any significant disruption to ensure that your learners know where to access course materials. The easiest way to manage this is to use the Moodle site that is automatically provisioned for every for-credit course offered in every semester at TWU. Keep in mind that you do not need to worry about designing a fully online course. All you need to do is to create a repository where you can communicate with learners and exchange files.

Here are some simple tasks to help you set up a basic Moodle site.

- [Accessing Moodle](https://create.twu.ca/help/moodle/basics/introduction)
- [Uploading files (syllabi, sample documents, etc) to Moodle](http://create.twu.ca/help/moodle/faculty/activity-or-resource/adding-resources)

##### Yes, email is a reasonable tool!
For some of you, it might be enough to upload a PDF or MS Word file with your syllabus and then manage communication and file exchange with your learners via email. There is a very long history of online learning using email. It actually extends far beyond that, though; distance learning and remote learning principles are evident in the New Testament epistles.

You can access student emails directly in Moodle by licking [I'm keeping the typo. Please don't lick your computer.] the 'Participants' link in the menu on the left side of the page.

##### Using Moodle to connect learners with Library resources
The TWU Library is accessible online, and there is a tool integrated in Moodle to allow you to create a share reading lists.

While you can technically upload PDF articles to Moodle, creating a reading list through the EBSCO Curriculum Builder ensures that your learners, especially those who require screen readers or other accommodations, are able to access resources in formats that make sense for them.

##### Using Moodle to manage assignments

The assignment tool in Moodle is very robust and allows for a completely digital workflow. You can create assignment dropboxes in Moodle that will allow you to communicate the details of the assignment to students, set due dates (optional, please consider that your learners lives have been significantly disrupted and due dates may be better framed as 'suggested targets'), gather assignment files as MS Word, PDF, Excel, or other filetypes.
