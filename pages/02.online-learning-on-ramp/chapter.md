Our Academic Technology Ambassadors (ATAs), who are all students, have completed their contracts and so we are adjusting how we will provide support through the summer.

#### Access our frequently asked questions page.
We have an extensive and growing list of [self-help tutorials here](https://create.twu.ca/help) and also in the menu bar in Moodle under 'Resources'.

#### Create a ticket
The best way to ensure someone will see your request is to  create a ticket by emailing [elearning@twu.ca](mailto:elearning@twu.ca) or visiting [twu.ca/help](https://twu.ca/help).

#### Join the team in MS Teams
We have created a Team in Microsoft Teams, [please join the team at this link.](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/team/19%3ac4a16207670f47488af233b44bbf601a%40thread.tacv2/conversations?groupId=44141a65-3057-4afb-aa95-a85d566d4bd3&tenantId=2b4ef155-1673-43ef-a480-230c3d483f16) You will be prompted for a code, which is `nee3yxh`.
