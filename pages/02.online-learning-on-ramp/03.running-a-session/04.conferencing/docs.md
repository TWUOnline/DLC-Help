Video conferencing is a great way to connect with students online. Consider having weekly sessions, allowing time to teach content, explain assignments, facilitate student discussions, and assess students (presentations, etc.)

! Note that you can record these sessions and post them to Moodle so students can access the recordings.

### Using web-conferencing tools to connect synchronously

##### zoom.us

You can now go to [twu.zoom.us](https://twu.zoom.us), tap or click 'Sign In' and sign in to Zoom using your TWU Pass credentials.

OR, if you already have the Zoom app installed, you can open it and choose 'Sign In with SSO' and use your TWU Pass credentials.

![alt_text](zoom-2.png "Zoom App Sign-in")

Once you are signed in, we recommend that you schedule **one** Zoom session per course that you are teaching. You may choose to only use one session for multiple courses as well. It is not recommended to schedule multiple sessions for the same course as it will become confusing which session to use.

###### Click 'Schedule a Meeting'

TWU continues to provide central management of BlueJeans for web-conferencing, however, our service agreement with BlueJeans will expire after April 30, 2020.

If you have access to a BlueJeans license through TWU, you may continue to use that license as normal until April 30. you do not need to move to a Zoom account now.

!! TWU will **NOT** be providing NEW BlueJeans licenses to faculty at this time. If you do not currently use BlueJeans and want to set up web-conferencing for the remainder of your classes, please see the instructions above to sign in to Zoom.

##### Other services
There are several other options for faculty who may have already established means of synchronous communication such as Skype, FaceTime, Google Hangouts, Slack, Discord, etc. Our ability to troubleshoot these services will be very limited.

! If your students are to give **Class Presentations**, consider using video conferencing.  Students can share their screens of their notes/PowerPoints.  Sessions can be recorded for feedback purposes.
