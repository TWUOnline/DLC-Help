#### What is Blackboard Ally?

Blackboard Ally is a built-in accessibility tool integrated into our Moodle Learning Management System (LMS) that helps instructors build a more inclusive learning environment and improve the student experience by helping users take clear control of course content with usability, accessibility and quality in mind.

**For Students:**
- Ally creates multiple alternatives from the original documents in your course.  Alternative files include readable text for screen readers, pictures with captions, and easy-to-navigate content.  Students can download these alternative formats anywhere that files are used.
- *See the [Ally Student Guide](https://help.blackboard.com/Ally/Ally_for_LMS/Student/Quick_Start) for instructions on how to access alternative files.*

**For Faculty:**
- In your Moodle course, you may have noticed beside some files there is a coloured gauge with a number associated with it.  This tells you the accessibility score of the uploaded document.  If you click on the gauge, it will suggest ways to improve the file.  Often this involved adding ALT text to an image, or to re-scan a pdf so the font is more readable.

For more information on the Ally Accessibility tool, please see this [Quick Start Guide](https://help.blackboard.com/Ally/Ally_for_LMS/Instructor/Quick_Start).
