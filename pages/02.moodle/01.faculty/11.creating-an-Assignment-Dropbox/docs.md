The most commonly used Activities, Assignment Dropboxes allow students to submit assignments online. This is convenient for Instructors, as it eliminates the possibility of losing a studentâ€™s paper and as it enables students to submit their assignments immediately. It also connects to gradebook so students can see their grades once they are corrected.
